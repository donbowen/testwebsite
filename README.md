# Welcome to our [team project website!](https://julioveracruz.github.io/testwebsite/)

This is a website to showcase our final project for FIN 377 - Data Science for Finance course at Lehigh University.

Maybe you want a different website them for the project? Consider `minimal-mistakes`:
1. [Go here](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate).
2. In the resulting repo, click Settings, then Pages, then make sure the source is the main branch.
3. [The doc site is here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/structure/) and will help you customize layouts and figure out how to use it.

## Summary

The main goal of this project is to explore *(insert project idea here)*.

## Methodology

Here is some code that we used to develop our analysis. Note that for the purposes of the website, you have to copy this code into the markdown file and  
put the code inside trip backticks with the keyword `python`.

```python
import seaborn as sns 
iris = sns.load_dataset('iris') 

print(iris.head(),  '\n---')
print(iris.tail(),  '\n---')
print(iris.columns, '\n---')
print("The shape is: ",iris.shape, '\n---')
print("Info:",iris.info(), '\n---') # memory usage, name, dtype, and # of non-null obs (--> # of missing obs) per variable
print(iris.describe(), '\n---') # summary stats, and you can customize the list!
print(iris['species'].value_counts()[:10], '\n---')
print(iris['species'].nunique(), '\n---')
```

## Analysis

Here are some graphs that we created in our analysis. We saved them to the `pics/` subfolder and include them via the usual markdown syntax for pictures.
